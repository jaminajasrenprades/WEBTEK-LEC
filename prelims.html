				<dt id="intro">Introduction of Internet and World Wide Web</dt>
				<p>
				In today's world, people is more likely to be exposed to the Internet and World Wide Web (WWW). People considered the internet to have a huge resource of information but they don't appreciate the history or how it really works especially in creating and developing websites.
				</p>				
				<p>
				The World Wide Web, is a more advanced medium wherein anybody and anyone, as long as they have established a connection to any server within the web, can access, share, download and upload files on the fly. Media, however, when it involves the World Wide Web, becomes a compelling tool that could change the course of history.
				</p>
                <p>The World of Mass Media and Communication without the World Wide Web</p>
                <p>Without the web, the world would feel mundane, as we would still live in the old times. Information would only be found in newspapers, books, and in television, as well as the environment, though not as vast as opposed to the world of information with the web. There would be delay in the delivery of information to the masses, as seen in the papers, wherein in an example, the death of Adolf Hitler was only known to the world only 2 days after Hitler committed suicide. At the same time, delivery of news would only be restricted to one country, the most prominent and history changing only making it internationally. Nobody in Japan, for example, will know what is going on in France. There would be a near closed barrier between different races. As the world without the web would make it near impossible for two people of different nationalities to interact with, unless one of them goes into the country of the other. The worst disadvantage of all would be unawareness. There are epidemics that happen in different parts of the world, and some of them are detrimentally dangerous to the society. Some can happen in different parts of the world, and without full awareness, such can get bigger in a minute, drastically destroying society as a whole, which is if the web is not there to inform other people of precautionary measures.</p>
